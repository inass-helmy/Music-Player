## Important note

This is a simple music player built using ReactJS and Howler.js.
The project is deployed on gh-pages. Unfortunately github pages is loaded over HTTPS while the ccmixter API requests are over HTTP, so the API request is blocked.

### So to have fun listening to music using this player you should:

- clone the repo to your local device
- run "npm install" to install all the independecies and packages
- run "npm start" to run in your local host "http://localhost:3000/"
